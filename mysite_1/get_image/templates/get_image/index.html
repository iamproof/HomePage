	<h2> Web Image Scraping (wallbase.cc) </h2>
	<p>Hi! My names Jay and I'm a 20 year old web designer from England. My main projects are conducted through my website Six Shooter Media, but I (obviously) also enjoy creating Open Source web templates for general use! Another site of mine that you might find interesting if you're setting up a site with a free tmeplate like this is Buy a Button. There, for a great price you can purchase a link to your site in the form of a button. This link will obviously provide you site with some additional traffic which is always nice! Have Fun! <br> Search engine is from http://wallbase.cc/ - one of the best wallpapers portals.</p>
